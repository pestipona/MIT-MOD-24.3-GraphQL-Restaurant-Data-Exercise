## Learning Outcome Addressed:

9. Use GraphQL to query and update data

Creating **multi-tier applications** means building **multiple API endpoints** to handle **different data operations**. The **more complex** your **application becomes**, *the harder it is to* **maintain all these endpoints**. `GraphQL` aims to **reduce this complexity** by providing a **simpler view** of **data** and making it **easier to query** it.

Your task is to **set up** `GraphQL` for your **restaurant data** and then **add mutations** to **get** and **update these data**.

The [starter files](/Starter_Files) for this activity include the **restaurant data** in **JSON format** and a predefined **build schema** for `GraphQL`. You need to g**o through this code** to understand **what each query** or **mutation** should **look like**.

To **accomplish this task**, you **need to implement** the **following methods** under the `“root”` object:

* **restaurant:** This *gets* a *single restaurant* based on a *provided ID*.
* **restaurants:** This *gets* a *list of all* restaurants.
* **setrestaurant:** This *creates* a *new restaurant*.
* **Deleterestaurant:** This *deletes a restaurant* based on the *provided id*.
* **editrestaurant:** This *updates* a *restaurant* based on the *provided id*.

## Instructions:

After **completing the task**, run the **GraphQL interface** and **submit a file** with **screenshots** showing all **five queries** and **mutations** highlighted above, along with **a link** to your **GitHub repo** that **houses the code** for **this activity**.
