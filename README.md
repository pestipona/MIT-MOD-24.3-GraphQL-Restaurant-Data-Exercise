![GraphQL_Restaurant_Data_Exercise_02.jpg](Screen_Shots%2FGraphQL_Restaurant_Data_Exercise_02.jpg)

## Project Description:

This multi-stack application demonstrates the use of GraphQL to efficiently perform query and mutation operations on a sample restaurant database. The query operations include getting a list of all the restaurants in the database, and getting a particular restaurant based on its id. The mutation operations involve editing an existing restaurant, deleting a restaurant from the database, and finally adding a new restaurant.

### Technical Stack:

* **Frontend:** The frontend `index.js` is developed using modern web technologies like React.js.

* **Backend:** The backend is powered by a `Node.js` server, which handles GraphQL requests and interactions with the restaurant database.

* **Database:** The database is hardcoded in the `index.js` file. For now this is a limitation. Since the application is for demonstration of concept only.

* **GraphQL Server:** The `GraphQL` server acts as a middleware that efficiently processes queries and mutations, communicating with the database to fetch or update the required information.
